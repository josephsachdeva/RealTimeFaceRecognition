# RealTimeFaceRecognition
It recognizes people from the webcam of the laptop.

The project is associated with a training folder of the directory-
../training-data/

where s1, s2, s3, ... s(n) are the folder names and the images will be saved as numbers 1, 2, 3, .... (n) for every image.

The best part?
You just have to create the folder named as ../training-data/ and the trainig data will be automatically saved by the program when it runs.

Enjoy.
